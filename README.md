## Setup & Configuration

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jetsetgo.git
cd jetsetgo
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → Create a new project
2. Go to **Settings → API Keys → Legacy anon, service_role API keys**
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon** key
4. Go to **Table Editor** and create two tables:

**`users` table:**
| Column | Type |
|---|---|
| `id` | text (primary key) |
| `name` | text |
| `email` | text |
| `phone` | text |

**`bookings` table:**
| Column | Type |
|---|---|
| `id` | text (primary key) |
| `user_id` | text |
| `data` | json |
| `created_at` | text |

> Disable Row Level Security (RLS) on both tables.

5. Paste your keys into `script.js`:

```js
const SUPABASE_URL  = "https://xxxx.supabase.co";
const SUPABASE_ANON = "eyJ...your anon key...";
```

### 3. Set up EmailJS

1. Go to [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com) → Sign up free
2. Add a **Gmail service** → connect your Gmail → copy the **Service ID**
3. Create an **OTP template** with these variables:
   - **To Email:** `{{to_email}}`
   - **Subject:** `Your JetSetGo OTP: {{otp_code}}`
   - **Body:**
     ```
     Hi {{to_name}},
     Your OTP is: {{otp_code}}
     This code expires in 5 minutes.
     — JetSetGo Team
     ```
4. Create a **payment link template**:
   - **Subject:** `Complete your JetSetGo payment — #{{booking_id}}`
   - **Body:**
     ```
     Hi {{to_name}},
     You've been added to a group flight booking (#{{booking_id}}).
     Your share: {{amount}}
     Click here to pay: {{payment_link}}
     — JetSetGo Team
     ```
5. Paste all keys into `script.js`:

```js
const EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY       = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY";
const EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID       = "YOUR_SERVICE_ID";
const EMAILJS_OTP_TEMPLATE     = "YOUR_OTP_TEMPLATE_ID";
const EMAILJS_PAYMENT_TEMPLATE = "YOUR_PAYMENT_TEMPLATE_ID";
```

### 4. Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) → Add new site → Deploy manually
2. Drag your entire project folder onto the deploy area
3. Your site goes live instantly at a `*.netlify.app` URL

> The `netlify.toml` handles URL routing so both `/login` and `/login.html` work.

### 5. Run locally

```bash
# Option 1: Double-click index.html
# Option 2: VS Code Live Server extension
# Option 3: Python
python -m http.server 8000
```
